  <h1>WHY YOU NEED A CROCHET PIECE IN YOUR CLOSET</h1>
  <p>It's no brainer that crochet has made a comeback in the fashion world and it's time you join the bandwagon. If you are not familiar with crochet as of 2023 you might think that it's all boring sweaters, hats, kimonos and scarves but no. Crochet can make very beautiful and amazing pieces (you can check out crochet designers on Instagram to see for yourself).</p><br>
  <p>Crochet clothes come in the form of tops, bralettes, skirts, shorts, ruffle hats, shrugs, and many others. They can be as versatile as any other piece of clothing in your closet. Here is a list why you should own at least one crochet item in your closet.</p><br>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>They are pretty and unique:</strong> Who doesn’t want pretty and unique things?</li>
    <li><strong>They can be made into any design you want:</strong> This compliments the unique point made above. You can have an image in your mind about how you want your item to be like and your crochet artist makes it come to life. If you don’t like having the same shirt that everyone else in town then crochet gives you a chance to be unique.</li>
    <li><strong>They are versatile:</strong> Just like normal clothes, crochet items can be versatile too. Some are made to be worn in two or more different ways. This means you have many outfits in just one item. How good of a deal is that? They can also be styled in different ways. They can be worn with anything. You can wear that beautiful shrug underneath your normal t-shirt or above it, wear that bralette to the beach or to a night out with friends… the list is endless.</li>
    <li><strong>They can have in-built jewellery:</strong> Ikr! Who knew this was possible? This one depends on the crochet artist's ability to do so, however. I came across a crochet artist on Instagram who does this and to say I was awed would be an understatement. Her creations are just amazing. Here is a link to her Instagram page <a href="https://www.instagram.com/knottygirlthreads">@knottygirlthreads</a>. I promise you won't be disappointed.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Crochet supports sustainability as there is availability of organic yarns such as cotton, hemp, bamboo, and recycled yarn that can be used to make your crochet outfits if you don't like environmental pollution. Crochet items last for a very long time and if the design or item bores you the yarn can be used to make another different item/design, reducing wastage.</li>
    <li><strong>To keep you warm:</strong> It's essential for one to have cold-weather clothes in their closet before the onset of the cold season. You can have your crochet artist make you a puffy cardigan, an arm warmer, or a scarf to keep the cold at bay.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There are many reasons why you ought to have a crochet item in your closet, but these are some of them.</p><br></div></div>
